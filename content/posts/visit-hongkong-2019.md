## Take my kid go to Hong Kong

This will be his 1st civic education lesson, always support people find the *democracy* and *freedom*.

I'm not worried about the safty in Hong Kong, but i do care about my parents will stop us if they know our plan. So i decide not to tell them our holiday plan.

See you Hong Kong tomorrow! I love Hong Kong food and the freedom people really care about. Hope this trip will give my kid a good memory.

God bless Hong Kong people!
